Test bed for shaders (snake game)

It's not really meant to be a game, snake has been done to hell and back.
This is just what I consider minimally sufficient before I can start experimenting
with shaders and to see what I can come up with.

So far, here's what I know:

1. Draw to a Canvas, then blit the canvas through a shader to the screen.
2. Some shaders require you to send a parameter to them.
